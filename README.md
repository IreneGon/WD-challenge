Group: Kai & Irene
HTML page without CSS
white_check_mark: Rules (Must Have):
Must use appropriate HTML tags for your content (don’t use &lt;div&gt; for everything)
Must contain at least one list
Must contain at least a few images
Must contain a link to an external page (bonus points if you get the page to open in a new tab)
Must contain a form <-- no hard specifics for this, just make sure there’s at least two inputs, which are labelled and a button!
If you should have time and energy, some additional ideas (this is completely optional):
Use an HTML tag (or two!) that are not introduced in Colt’s course
Use a table
use different input types in your form
create a second page and navigation between the pages
