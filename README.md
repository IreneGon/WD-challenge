# WD-challenge 1
Group: Kai & Irene
HTML page without CSS
white_check_mark: Rules (Must Have):
Must use appropriate HTML tags for your content (don’t use &lt;div&gt; for everything)
Must contain at least one list
Must contain at least a few images
Must contain a link to an external page (bonus points if you get the page to open in a new tab)
Must contain a form <-- no hard specifics for this, just make sure there’s at least two inputs, which are labelled and a button!
If you should have time and energy, some additional ideas (this is completely optional):
Use an HTML tag (or two!) that are not introduced in Colt’s course
Use a table
use different input types in your form
create a second page and navigation between the pages
# WD-challenge 2
The rules (must have):
no javascript!
no inline styling (all your styles have to be in separate stylesheets)
style all the content of your page somehow
use flex box somewhere in your project

use at least one pseudo class ( like hover or active)
Nice to have (optional):
use different ways to select your HTML elements (element, class, descendant,…)
use a CSS variable somewhere
use the BEM naming convention for your CSS
use different units (e.g. rem, vh, %, px, …)
use a media query
